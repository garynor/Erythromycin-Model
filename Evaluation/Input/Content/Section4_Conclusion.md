The final erythromycin PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, glomerular filtration, and a dummy clearance technically implemented as hepatic plasma clearance accounting for additional clearance pathways, as well as mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4. Overall, the model adequately describes the oral pharmacokinetics of erythromycin in healthy adults receiving different single or multiple doses of several oral dosage forms.
