The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for erythromycin in healthy adults.

Erythromycin a macrolide antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, and others. Erythromycin is available in the form of various salts and formulations, for example as: 

- erythromycin lactobionate for injection
- erythromycin base in enteric-coated capsules or tablets for oral administration
- erythromycin stearate in filmcoated tablets for oral administration
- erythromycin ethylsuccinate in suspension or in filmcoated tablets for oral administration

In its free form as base, erythromycin is easily hydrolyzed in acidic aqueous solution ([Mordi 2000](# 5 References)). Therefore, orally administered erythromcyin is given in the form of enteric-coated formulations or as more acid-stable salts or esters of erythromycin (e.g. erythromycin ethylsuccinate). Once in the small intestine, erythromycin is rapidly absorbed displaying a highly variable bioavailability ([Chun 1977](# 5 References), [Mather 1981](# 5 References)). Erythromycin diffuses in most tissues and accumulates in leukocytes and phagocytes ([Miller 1984](# 5 References), [Carlier 1987](# 5 References)). About 70% of erythromycin is bound to plasma proteins ([Barre 1987](# 5 References)). Erythromycin has been shown to be a substrate for various transporters including P-gp and OATP1B1. The latter has been shown to critically affect erythromycin disposition ([Lancaster 2012](# 5 References)). Erythromycin is extensively metabolized through N-demethylation catalyzed by CYP3A. Metabolism via CYP4F11 has also been suggested ([Kalsotra 2004](# 5 References)). Biliary excretion also appears to play an important role in erythromycin clearance ([Acocella 1968](# 5 References), [Chelvan 1979](# 5 References)), but tits contribution to total elimination remains unknown. The dose fraction excreted unchanged in urine is minimal and highly variable; reported fractions range from 0.018 ± 0.005 to 0.171 ± 0.11 (mean ± SD) ([Pasic 1987](# 5 References), [Austin 1980](# 5 References)). Erythromycin is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and listed by the FDA as clinical index inhibitor for CYP3A.
